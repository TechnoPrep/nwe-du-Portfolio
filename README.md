# <Portfolio Webpage>
## Description
This Portfolio is built so that it can house my future projects so I will have the ability to showcase my accomplishments to future employers. It is, in itself, a project to future employers, with my use of flex boxes, mobile responsiveness, and JQuery use with my hamburger menu.

Motivation / Inspiration: 
- My motivation and inspiration was to push myself with creativity for page design, and my love of the 80's Synthwave genre to really give myself enjoyment and fulfillment in the work that I create.
